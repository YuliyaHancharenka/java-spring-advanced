# Practical task repository for Comments 

## General Task Guidelines

*    Please make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
*    The task repository may contain one or more than one practical task per given topic, you are expected to complete all the tasks.
*    Tasks are Java based and it is NOT mandatory to use the latest language versions while making code updates, but you are able to change language version.
*    It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
*    A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
*    While making changes, any files contained inside package named as 'thirdpartyjars' should be ignored. These file are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
*    Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.


## Review Process

*    Participants should announce the completion of a task using agreed collaboration tool within the group. This makes them eligible for reviewing other's submissions for a given task.
*    You should assign such eligible participants to review your code after you announce your code completion for a task.
*    Every submission should be reviewed by 3  mandatory reviewers, and it also means that each participant should review at least 3 other submissions after he or she submit own task.
*    Participants can choose reviewers, but 2 from 3 reviewers should differ from previous module reviewers.
*    All the Participants should incorporate all review comments.
*    In case of any conflict in opinion, to clarify, you should reach a Review Champion/ Engx Mentor/ Cleancode Author in that order till your query/conflict is resolved.
